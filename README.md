# SÃ¶ka pass (Isabelle)

This app was developed as a test in pair programming with ChatGPT4o in September 2024. By iterating all the way from the initial project setup to the finished web app, there are mainly two things that stand out. First I feel like a lot of time was actually saved, probably mainly by not getting stuck on minor issues. Then the final code looked pretty good. A lot of randomness in the implementation, because of my own way of implementing things could be avoided and the result became quite nice and tidy. However, the total amount of typing probably did not go down a lot, since quite detailed explanations was needed to describe what I wanted. One additional observation was that while javascript and html worked very well, the major weakness of the chatbot seemed to lie in the css. I finally had to go in and fix things myself, even though I'm pretty bad at css.
